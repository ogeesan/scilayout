It aims to make laying out figures easy, fast, and maybe even fun. The idea is to make and interact with Matplotlib axes in centimetres from the top left, which when combined with existing interactive plotting tools makes building plots in Python a breeze.</p> Example usage<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import scilayout\n\n# Create a figure object\n&gt;&gt;&gt; fig = scilayout.figure()\n\n# Create a panel, specifying location in cm from top left\n&gt;&gt;&gt; myax = fig.add_panel((1, 1, 5, 5))\n\n# move the panel after it's been created and set it's location based on size\n&gt;&gt;&gt; myax.set_location((2, 10, 3, 3), method='size')\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#why-use-this","title":"Why use this?","text":"<ol> <li>Powerful figure design: there are practically no limits when it comes to building figures with Matplotlib</li> <li>Universal skills: rather than learning proprietary software you can utilise flexible and transferable Python and Matplotlib skills.</li> <li>Text based source: version control, portability, and visual fiddling are as easy as managing text files.</li> <li>Vector graphics: make use of Matplotlib's renderer to gain huge flexibility of quality output.</li> </ol> <p>A classic problem is choosing colours for all of the elements in your figures.
