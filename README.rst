What is ``scilayout``?
==================
Scilayout is a Python package to make creating multi-panel scientific figures easier, faster, and maybe a little bit more fun.
The core idea is to build figures using coordinates in **centimetres from the top left** using interactive plotting.
This approach has a few main benefits:

1. The iterative process of building figures up from scratch is easier
2. Complex layouts can be interchanged more easily
3. Exported figure sizes are explicitly stated (in centimetres) for seamless embedding in documents

There are many guides for Matplotlib styling for scientific publication, and there are a number of packages that make this process easier (e.g. `SciencePlots <https://github.com/garrettj403/SciencePlots>`_), but creating complete multi-panel figures is a separate thing.
